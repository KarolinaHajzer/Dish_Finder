Sweet & sour cucumber noodles;Cook the soba noodles in boiling water, but undercook them by about 2-3 minutes. I boil them in water for about 5 minutes for this recipe, instead of the suggested 7-8 minutes. Immediately drain and rinse, combine with the soy sauce, and set aside. Meanwhile, using a julienne peeler, a mandoline, a spiralizer, or a sharp knife, thinly slice the cucumbers until theyâ€™re noodle-like. (*You can just cut them into small chunks if you prefer, but you can find a super easy julienne slicer, which is what I use.) Set the noodles aside. In a large bowl or glass jar, combine the rice vinegar and the honey, then whisk or shake well. Coat the cucumber noodles in the dressing and set aside or chill for about 30 minutes. Mix with the soba noodles and serve.;soba noodles,soy sauce,cucumber,rice vinegar,honey
Summer pasta with tomatoes and peas;Boil water in a large skillet, sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon salt and toss in pasta. Boil water in the same skillet for peas this time. Drop the peas in the boiling water and cook until tender but still a bit firm, for about 5-10 minutes. Add the halved cherry tomatoes, put a lid on the skillet and let the tomatoes get a little tender for about 5 minutes stirring a few times. Toss in pasta, peas and 1/4 cup water in which you cook pasta. Stir and take it from heat.;peas,tomatoes,oil,eggs,cucumber
Vegetable fried rice;Add whisked eggs to wok, let cook and set for a minute. Break up eggs with your spatula or spoon (I use this bamboo stir fry spatula) into small pieces. Add frozen mixed vegetables and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add brown rice and soy sauce to vegetable and egg mixture and cook for up to 5 minutes or until all is heated through. Season well with coarse salt, fresh ground pepper and additional soy sauce to taste. Serve with red chili sauce or sriracha.;oil,eggs,vegetables,rice
